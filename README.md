# 🎮 2048++

An enhanced version of the classic 2048 game, now with even more fun features! This is a little project I whipped up in my spare time—hope it brings you some joy!

## 🎯 Game Intro

2048 is a simple yet addictive number-merging game. On a 4x4 grid, swipe up, down, left, or right to merge tiles with the same number. The goal? Reach 2048 (but hey, you can keep going for even higher scores)!

**How to play:**
- Use arrow keys or WASD to move the tiles.
- When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one.
- After each move, a new 2 or 4 will randomly appear in an empty spot.
- The game ends when there are no more moves left.

## ✨ Special Features

### 1. Undo Function
- Made a wrong move? No worries!
- Just hit the "Undo" button to go back one step.
- You can undo as many times as you like, all the way back to the start.
- Never let a slip of the finger ruin your game again!

### 2. Secret Cheat Mode
- Enter the magic sequence: ←←→→ →→←← (left, left, right, right,  right, right, left, left)
- All tiles will magically turn into 128!
- It’s an Easter egg, just for fun.
- Pro tip: Cheating is fun, but don’t overdo it! 😉
